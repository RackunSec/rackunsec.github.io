## The Demon Pentest Shell
A simple shell wrapper for superior logging capabilities, the Demon Pentest Shell is built by penetration testers for penetration testers and Red and Purple Teams.

## Logging
All commands are logged to daily-labeled CSV files within the ```~/.dps/logs/``` directory with the values of: 
* _When_
* _Host_ 
* _Network_ 
* _Who_ 
* _Where_ 
* _What_

## A New Shell
The idea for this shell came out of the need to have timestamp-perfect execution times for Penetration tests, Red Team engagements, 
and Purple Team engagaements. The shell also shares it's history/log files with all instances of the shell. These history/log files 
rotate each day. So you can have multiple shells open in multiple terminal emulators that all share the same history. The shell also has built-in configuration commands for customizations. 

The shell has the following features:
* Built-in updating feature
* Built-in commands and programming logic
* Built-in templates to import your own Python code as a module/built-in command
* Tons of Themes
* Obsidian Timelines configuration settings
* Session Aliases and Variables
* Keyboard shortcuts that should be familiar ;)
* more to come!

** Notice the bright green timestamp that was spat out before running the ```nmap``` command? This is a compatible timestamp that you can use with your [Obsidian knowledge base vault](https://obsidian.md/) for your penetration test. Simply install the [Timelines plugin](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines) to Obsidian to get started.

## Download and Install
The repository for the DPS shell [can be found here.](RackunSec/DPS). Installation is as easy as running a ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` and simply executing the ```./dps.py``` file.
