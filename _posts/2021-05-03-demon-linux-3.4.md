Demon Linux is a penetration tester-themed distribution of Debian Linux. This project is a new spin on the WeakNet Linux pentesting distribution that I began in 2008.

This distribution was built out of the frustrations that I had with current off-the-shelf penetration testing distributions. Demon Linux is also a packaged environment in which I can distribute all of my own custom tools. Such as the Demon Pentest Shell and the Demon App Store.
