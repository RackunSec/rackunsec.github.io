## Download and Installation
You can download a copy of the Demon Linux ISO [from my website here](https://demonlinux.com). Installation is pretty straight forward, but ensure that you are only installing it within VMWare as I cannot support all hardware for systems all over the world. Keeping your penetration testing distribution containerized with VMWare is a convenient way to restore it and shred sensitive information after each penetration test you perform for your clients.
