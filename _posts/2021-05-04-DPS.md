## The Demon Pentest Shell
![Demon Pentest Shell screenshot in Demon Linux 3.4.x](/assets/img/screenshots/dps-screeny.png)

A simple shell wrapper for superior logging capabilities. All commands are logged to daily-labeled CSV files within the ```~/.dps/logs/``` directory with the values of: 
* _When_
* _Host_ 
* _Network_ 
* _Who_ 
* _Where_ 
* _What_

The shell also has built-in configuration commands for customizations. 
## A New Shell
The idea for this shell came out of the need to have timestamp-perfect execution times for Penetration tests, Red Team engagements, 
and Purple Team engagaements. The shell also shares it's history/log files with all instances of the shell. These history/log files 
rotate each day. So you can have multiple shells open in multiple terminal emulators that all share the same history. 

The shell has the following features:
* Built-in updating feature
* Built-in commands and programming logic
* Tons of Themes
* Obsidian Timelines configuration settings
* Session Aliases
* Keyboard shortcuts that should be familiar ;)
* more to come!

## Download and Install
The repository for the DPS shell [can be found here.](RackunSec/DPS). Installation is as easy as running a ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` and simply executing the ```./dps.py``` file.
