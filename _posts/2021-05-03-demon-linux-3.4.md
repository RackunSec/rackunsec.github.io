## Penetration Testing
Demon Linux is a penetration tester-themed distribution of Debian Linux. This project is a new spin on the WeakNet Linux pentesting distribution that I began in 2008.

This distribution was built out of the frustrations that I had with current off-the-shelf penetration testing distributions. Demon Linux is also a packaged environment in which I can distribute all of my own custom tools. Such as the Demon Pentest Shell and the Demon App Store.
## Security
The latest version of my [Custom Debian Installer](https://github.com/RackunSec/Demon-Linux-Installer) allows you to set a secure root password showing you password stats, and alos allows yous to encrypt your entire drive using LUKS.

## Download and Installation
You can download a copy of the Demon Linux ISO from my website [here](https://demonlinux.com). Installation is pretty straight forward, but ensure that you are only installing it within VMWare as I cannot support all hardware for systems all over the world.
