Douglas McLain Berdeaux: Rack√ºn Security: (previously WeakNet Labs) Founder, Python Newbie, Agile/Scrum Master, OSCP, OSWP, CSM, LINUX dev, and Sr. Pentester at Red Siege. I'm a vegetarian, I live with my wife and a handful of bunnies in Pennsylvania, I like watercolor painting, Speed-running Call of Duty Zombies easter eggs, and I have a slight obsession with Neo Geo (@MVSXPro).
